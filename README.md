# Project Completion Report: Stock Analysis Script

## Overview:
The goal of this project was to create a VBA script that analyzes stock data for multiple years. The script calculates and outputs the yearly change, percentage change, and total stock volume for each stock. Additionally, it identifies the stocks with the greatest percentage increase, greatest percentage decrease, and greatest total volume. The script has been designed to run on every worksheet (representing each year's data) and uses conditional formatting to highlight positive and negative changes.

## Results:

The script successfully analyzes stock data for every year, providing comprehensive information on each stock's performance.
The identified "Greatest" metrics offer insights into notable stock trends for each year.

## Performance:

The script has been optimized to run efficiently on the provided dataset (alphabetical_testing.xlsx), completing the analysis in under 3 to 5 minutes.
Consistency Across Sheets:

The script ensures consistent execution on every sheet, maintaining the same analysis structure for each year's data.

## Final Note:

The completed VBA script simplifies and accelerates the process of stock data analysis. Users can now execute the script with a click of a button, saving time and ensuring uniformity in the analysis across multiple years.
